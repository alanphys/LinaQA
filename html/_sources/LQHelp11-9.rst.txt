Spatial Resolution
==================

These contain customisable options for :ref:`spatialres`. Available settings are:

*  **Bar widths mm**: Comma delimited list of bar widths in mm for each quadrant. A line pair will be 2x this value. Applies to :ref:`quadrant`
*  **Distance from centre**: The distance from the center of the image to the center of the ROI in mm. Applies to :ref:`quadrant`
*  **ROI diameter mm**: The diameter of the ROI in mm. Applies to :ref:`quadrant`
*  **ROI width mm**: The width of the ROI. This is the width in the parallel to the sample lines. Applies to :ref:`fourbar`.
*  **Resolution test**: Default spatial resolution test.
*  **Separation mm**: The distance between the two peaks formed by the bars in x or y direction in mm. The length of the ROI to sample will be 2x the separation perpendicular to the sample lines. Applies to :ref:`fourbar`.
