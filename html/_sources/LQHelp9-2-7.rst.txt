Winston-Lutz Analysis
=====================

Analyse a Winston-Lutz type EPID series, ie., single centered ball bearing. The analysis can be opened by clicking the |wl| button on the :ref:`rxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Radiotherapy, Winston-Lutz' from the :ref:`analysemenu`. Currently the Multi-Target Winston-Lutz is not implemented.

While the default settings are usually sufficient certain settings can be changed as given in :ref:`winstonlutzsettings`.

Please see the `Winston-Lutz Module <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/winston_lutz.html>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
