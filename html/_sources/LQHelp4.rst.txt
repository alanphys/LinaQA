System Requirements
===================

LinaQA can run on a variety of platforms and operating systems. Currently LinaQA is
tested on:

* Fedora 42/KDE 6.05/QT 5.15
* Window 10/Miniconda3

Windows users will need to install a python stack (such as anaconda) and PyQT5/QT5.

The program needs approximately 200 MB of disk space to install. A 19" monitor or
larger is not essential but will make viewing easier. LinaQA should not be viewed
at a resolution of less than 1280x1024. Other linux versions such as GTK or Apple Mac based may be available on request.
