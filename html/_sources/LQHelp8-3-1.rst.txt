Auto window
===========

Rescales the window level and width on the :ref:`imagetab` so that the image maximum is the brightest displayable value (white) and the image minimum is the darkest displayable value (black). The window level and width can be rescaled by clicking the |auto| button on the :ref:`dxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Auto window' from the :ref:`imagemenu`. This is a non-destructive operation, i.e. it does not change the image data.
