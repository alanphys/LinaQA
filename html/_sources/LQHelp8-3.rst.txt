Image Menu
==========

The Image Menu contains various operations that can be performed on the image or image series. These operations are also available on the :ref:`dxtoolbar`. While all the image operations are included on the :ref:`dxtoolbar` a distinction is made in the :ref:`mainmenu` between operations that edit an image, process an image or images, and those that return an analysis result. Image edit operations can be found under the :ref:`editmenu`. Image analysis operations can be found in the 'Analysis, Radiology' submenu of the :ref:`mainmenu`. Currently available image processing options are:

*  :ref:`autowindow`
*  :ref:`invert`
*  :ref:`scaleimage`
*  :ref:`sumimage`
*  :ref:`aveimage`
