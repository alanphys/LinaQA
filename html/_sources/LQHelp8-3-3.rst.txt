Scale Image
===========

Scales the image values by 'Scale Factor'. The image can be inverted by clicking the |scale| button on the :ref:`dxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Scale' from the :ref:`imagemenu`. This is a destructive operation, i.e. it changes the image data. The 'Scale Factor' can be set from the :ref:`dxtoolbar` or in :ref:`pydicomsettings`.

|Note| Image data will be changed. Save the image to make the changes permanent.
