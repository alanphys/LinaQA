Average Image
=============

Averages the loaded image series to a single image. All the loaded images are used. Images must be of a single type, i.e. same size and pixel representation. The images can be averaged by clicking the |ave| button on the :ref:`dxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Average Image' from the :ref:`imagemenu`. This is a destructive operation, i.e. it changes the image data.

|Note| Image data will be changed. Save the image to make the changes permanent.
