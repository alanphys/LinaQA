VMAT Analysis
=============

Analyse images acquired during Varian's Dose Rate - Gantry Speed and MLC Leaf Speed tests. The analysis can be opened by clicking the |vmat| button on the :ref:`rxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Radiotherapy, Picket Fence' from the :ref:`analysemenu`. The speed test type can be selected from the list box underneath the |vmat| button. The default test can be specified in :ref:`vmatsettings` settings. The tests that are currently implemented are:

*  Dose Rate - Gantry Speed (DRGS)
*  Dose Rate - MLC Leaf Speed (DRMLC)

While the default settings are usually sufficient certain settings can be changed as given in :ref:`vmatsettings` settings. Please see the `VMAT Module <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vmat_docs.html>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
