Tabbed Workspace
================

The tabbed workspace is where images and references are displayed, DICOM tags are viewed and edited. Notes are edited, and where pixel data can be edited for DICOM images. The actions below will open a tab in the workspace. Once more than one tab is open you can move between them by clicking the appropriate tab.

*  |open| :ref:`fileopen`
*  |openref| :ref:`fileopenref`
*  |editdcm| :ref:`dcmtoolbar`
*  |editpx| :ref:`editpixeldata`
*  |editnote| :ref:`editusernote`

Each tab operates differently. Select the tab below for functions that are available in the tab.
