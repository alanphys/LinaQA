Machine Log Analysis
====================

Analyse Varian linear accelerator machine logs. The analysis can be opened by clicking the |ml| button on the :ref:`rxtoolbar` or by selecting 'Radiotherapy, Machine Logs' from the :ref:`analysemenu`. There are currently no settings associated with the Machine Log analysis.

Please see the `Log Analyzer Module <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/log_analyzer.html>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

|Note| Machine log files are neither image nor DICOM files and so will generate a warning when you open them. However, they can still be analysed.
