Could not analyze image(s). Reason: ...
---------------------------------------

LinaQA was unable to analyse the opened files. The error message causing the analysis to fail is returned. The most common cause is selecting the wrong test for the type of image. E.g. selecting a picket fence analysis on a Winston-Lutz image. Other reasons may be poor image quality or artifacts in the image.
