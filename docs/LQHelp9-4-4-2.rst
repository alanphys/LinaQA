Quadrant Spatial Resolution Analysis
====================================

Calculates the spatial resolution in terms of the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) and moments based Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of a Gamma Camera image using a four quadrant line phantom.

While the default settings are usually sufficient certain settings can be changed as given in :ref:`spatialressettings` settings.

Please see `Four Quadrant Spatial Resolution <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nuclear.html#four-quadrant-spatial-resolution>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
