Tomographic Uniformity Analysis
===============================

Calculates the integral and differential uniformity of a SPECT image or series of images. Images between the 'First frame' and 'Last frame' settings are averaged together and the analysis is done on the resulting image. The analysis can be opened by clicking the |tu| button on the :ref:`nmtoolbar` or by selecting 'Tomographic Uniformity' from the :ref:`nucmedmenu` analysis menu.

The 'First frame' and 'Last frame' as well as other settings can be set in :ref:`tomouniformitysettings` settings.

Please see `Tomographic Uniformity <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nuclear.html#tomographic-uniformity>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
