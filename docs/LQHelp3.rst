Conventions in this Manual
==========================

Various typefaces and punctuation symbols are used to indicate actions that
the user must perform. Here is a list of these actions and their meanings.




-   Words in a courier font indicate letters that must be typed in on the
    keyboard. These will usually be data that should be typed into a field.

-   Words between single quotes, e.g. 'Start', usually indicate the name
    of a menu option, field or button.

-   Words between angular brackets, e.g. <Enter>, indicate a key that
    should be pressed. A combination of keys is indicated by a dash '-', for
    example <Alt-F> means you should press the <Alt> key and the <F> key
    together. Keys following each other are indicated by a comma ',', for
    example <Alt-F,S> means that you should press the <Alt> key together with
    the <F> key, release them and then press the <S> key.

-   An icon like this |Note| indicates important information about which you should be aware.

-   A hint or short cut is shown like this |Hint|.

It should be mentioned here that when this manual uses the word 'field' it is
referring to a place in the program window where data is entered and not a
radiation treatment field unless it is specifically stated.
