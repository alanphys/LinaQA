Errors and Troubleshooting
==========================

Error and warning messages are reported via the :ref:`statusbar`. LinaQA will always attempt to analyse the loaded file(s). However, the image(s) or file(s) may not be appropriate for the analysis and generate an error. Error messages are highlighted in Red and will stop further activity or analysis until the error condition is cleared. Warning messages are highlighted in Yellow. The analysis or operation will continue, but may be invalid. It is the responsibility of the user to verify the correctness of all results.

|Hint| Some errors may be generated by the Python subsystem and third party libraries and will not be displayed. The program may terminate unexpectedly. In this case start the program again in a console and perform the sequence of actions causing the error. The error message should be displayed in the console.

Possible error messages are:
