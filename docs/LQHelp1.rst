Introduction
============

LinaQA (pronounced Linakwa) is a GUI frontend for pylinac and pydicom. It is intended to be a general purpose medical physics quality assurance tool for radiotherapy, nuclear medicine and diagnostic radiology. In addition to a comprehensive implementation of the radiotherapy and nuclear medicine quality assurance analysis from pylinac LinaQA is also a fully fledged DICOM viewer and editor. Non-image DICOM files will automatically be opened in the DICOM editor tab.

Further documentation on pylinac and pydicom can be found below:

    * `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    * `Pydicom documentation <https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/stable/>`_

LinaQA primarily operates on DICOM images, but in certain instances can use JPEG and TIFF files. Non-image files such as machine log files can also be opened, but will not be displayed.

Basic image processing is available and images can be edited on a pixel basis.

This manual assumes that you are familiar with using your operating system. If you are not then please consult the appropriate documentation and on-line help. BeamScheme can run on a variety of operating systems and while a thorough knowledge of your specific system is not necessary some basic knowledge such as running files will be an advantage.
