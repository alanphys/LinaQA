ACR Phantoms
============

Automatically analyzes DICOM images of the American College of Radiology (ACR) CT and MRI phantoms. The images can be from either a CT or CBCT, or MRI. A PDF report of results is generated and saved in the image directory. No customisable settings are currently implemented.

Please see the `ACR Phantoms Module <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/acr.html#>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

|Note| Not all settings have been implemented.
