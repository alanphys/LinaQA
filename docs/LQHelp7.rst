Using LinaQA
============

LinaQA has a simple workflow. Open your image. Enable the toolbar that has the analysis you need if it is not already enabled. Click the analysis. The PDF will automatically be saved in the image directory. Although LinaQA is at its heart a frontend for pylinac and pydicom it has considerable additional functionality and understanding the various components and their functions will aid in using LinaQA.
