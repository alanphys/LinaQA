Winston-Lutz
============

These contain customisable options for the :ref:`winstonlutz`. Available settings are:

*  **BB Size**: The expected diameter of the BB in mm.
*  **Low density BB**: Set this flag to True if the BB is lower density than the material surrounding it.
*  **Open field**: If True, sets the field center to the EPID center under the assumption the field is not the focus of interest or is too wide to be calculated.

|Note| Not all settings have been implemented.
