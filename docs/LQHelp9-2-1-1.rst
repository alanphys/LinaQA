Catphan Series
==============

Automatically analyzes DICOM images of a CatPhan 503, 504, 600, 604 or 700. The images can be from a CT or CBCT. A PDF report of results is generated and saved in the image directory. The default phantom can be specified in :ref:`3Dphantomsettings` settings. While the default settings are usually sufficient certain settings can be changed in :ref:`3Dphantomsettings` settings.

Please see the `CatPhan Module <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cbct.html#>`_ in the `Pylinac documentation <https://pylinac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.
